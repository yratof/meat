## Meat is a bones fork with muscle.

It's using the fantastic bones theme as a skeleton and beefs it up to become a more powerful starting theme.

## History

Meat is mainly a collaborative effort between the excellent front-end developers [Eivin Landa](https://www.forsvunnet.co.uk) and [Andrew Lazarus](http://www.eyeversuseye.com/). We produce a lot of wordpress powered websites and our prefered starting theme has been bones, but we've recognized that there is room for improvement and we've set out to make a more fleshed out starting theme.

Meat will feature a more complete mobile design and experience along with a more developed tablet and desktop view. Furthermore it comes packed with a few nifty functions for both PHP and JavaScript.

### Bones

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)

Special Thanks to:
* Eddie Machado for the original Bones Theme
* Paul Irish & the HTML5 Boilerplate
* Yoast for some WP functions & optimization ideas
* Andrew Rogers for code optimization
* David Dellanave for speed & code optimization
* and several other developers. :)
